![showcase](../assets/showcase.jpg?raw=true)

Many years ago - in the times of mighty warriors and bloodthirsty monsters - two powerful kingdoms were in constant battle for influence and territory of Nordlundia continent.
Azagard - the kingdom of king Bombudron, wicked midget and tyrant, who took over the throne using trick and conspiracy.
And Mysterion - the kingdom of king Kanalimbur - ancient hero, the bringer of prosperity and utility.
These two almighty powers were balancing one another - like fire and water, like sky and earth, good and evil, ancient Yin and Yang.
But insidious Bombudron, lacking honour or loyalty made a plot... threatening the life of king Kanalimbur...
Together with his army of rebels he attacked Kanalimbur's castle.
Although king Kanalimbur fought bravely, he was not able to resist the power of too numerous and insidious enemy.
King Kanalimbur got captured... and the very next day... executed...
Since that day, the sun of Nordlunida went out and the stars fell into the ground... the one hundred years of darkness began...
Insidious Bombudron won more and more battles, taking over almost all of the Nordlundia continent.
After five centuries of ceaseless conquests, only one little village remained... Janamunda - called after the goddess Janamunda - the goddes of beauty and fertility...
Because in this very village, the last descendant of king Kanalimbur was born - invincible warrior, marked as the savior of this lend by prophecy of an old sage...
Because in this very village, you were born... my son.
